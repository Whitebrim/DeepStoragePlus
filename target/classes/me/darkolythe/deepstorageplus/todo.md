##For Wireless terminal: - DONE
- create texture
- linking feature will be in config page. bottom right item
- When linked, the item will get 'linked to DSU at:', 'x', 'y', 'z'
- x y z will be how we get the inventory and update it

##For crafting terminal:
- Honestly idk where the item should be yet
- Will have to look into recipes that contain items in the inventory. May be too inefficient

##For IO upgrades:
- There should be something in hopper listener :D
